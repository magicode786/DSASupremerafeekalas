Hi All,
How is the Josh!! I am starting this DSA series to revise my learnings of Data Structures and Algorithms course taught by Love Babbar on Code Help platform. I will be complementing the course content with my understanding and research. 
Today 21/08/2023, I had an orientation class of DSA today. Live and recorded classes are scheduled. I have discord serve to resolve my doubts. This course helps me to become SUPREME in DSA. So, I can utilize this course to improve my problem-solving skills.
Thanks, and see you guys in next class.

Today in second class of DSA, Following are the topics I have learnt today
Thought Process to solve problems.
What is Algorithm?
What is Flow Chart?

Thought process to solve problems:
There are three steps to solve the problem:
a. Understanding the problem.
b. Find out the input values given.
c. Build Approach, create Logic and Algorithm.
Firstly, I need to understand the given problem and write the problem in your own language. Secondly, solution will be thought out in Mind, thirdly it will be written on the paper roughly with the help of flow chart and Pseudo Code. Fourthly, write the source code in the computer understandable language next it will be converted to Machine language with the help of Compiler.
Computer will be used to perform the repetitive and automated tasks.
Flow Chart:
Flow chart is graphical or diagrammatic representation of algorithm. Following image explains flow chart and its components.

Flow Chart in computer ProgrammingPseudo Code - 
It is a detailed yet readable description of algorithm or what is computer program must do, expressed in a formally-styled natural language rather than in a programming language.

Different Examples of flowcharts/algorithms and Pseudo code.
1. Sum and Difference of two numbers - Start - Read two numbers a and b - Sum C = a + b; Difference D = a - b; Print Sum C, Difference D; End.

Start - Read two numbers a and b - Sum C = a + b; Difference D = a - b; Print Sum C, Difference D; End.
